# PawAndOrder
Working as a team, Alyssa Feutz and I created a database and UI that Paw and Order, a fictional dog training business, can use to streamline their day-to-day operations. Users can access data on business employees, customers, dogs, individual training sessions, commands taught by trainers, and commands that have been learned by individual dogs. The project was created using Python, Flask, CSS, and a MySQL database.
