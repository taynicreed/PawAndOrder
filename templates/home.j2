        Alyssa Feutz and Taylor Reed have paired up with a dog training business to implement a database to help manage the company. Paw and Order helps pet parents effectively train their dogs, leading to a happier life for both humans and pups. Yearly, they work with roughly 100 human clients and have a staff of 5 expert trainers who train approximately 200 dogs, along with an employee who is the office manager. As a growing business, they need a way to efficiently keep track of employees, clients (both human and canine), specific commands they offer training on, and details about training sessions. A database driven website will allow trainers to record details about training sessions so they can easily review what commands their clients have learned and store notes for future use. These details will be available for all employees to review, allowing for easy transition if a clientâ€™s needs or schedules lead them to work with multiple trainers. They hope this database will allow them to further grow their business and support an eventual transition to multi-species training.
